# Visual Programming in JupyterLab using Blockly
## PyData-Paris-2022
Presentation slides and material for PyData Paris 2022 conference.

### Demos
If you just want to try out the `jupyterlab-blockly` examples, you just need to have installed the `jupyterlab-blockly` extension.
```
conda install jupyterlab-blockly -c conda-forge
```

You need to have the `jupyterlab-lego-boost` extension installed for the `boost-movement.jpblocky`, `boost-circle.jpblockly` and `boost-demo.jpblockly` examples and Vernie setup. You can find the instructions for that [here](https://github.com/QuantStack/jupyterlab-lego-boost), in the official Github repository. 

If you install the `jupyterlab-lego-boost` extension, you can also run the Blockly examples on it (no need to install `jupyterlab-blockly` as well).
